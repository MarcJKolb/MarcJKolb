### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with experience in SQL and Python. I also have 10 years of experience as a physics educator using data and statistical analysis to differentiate content and lesson delivery in both urban and rural public schools. Through these experiences, I have focused on data science, completing a data science certification through Springboard in March of 2023 where I completed two end-to-end capstone projects.
